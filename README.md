# LLM-for-surgical-training
• Developed an innovative approach to surgical training using a Large Language Model (LLM) for personalized feedback during suturing tasks.

• Conducted a study involving 20 participants, each completing multiple suturing trials, to assess the effectiveness of LLM feedback.

• Utilized an optical tracker to record forceps and needle driver poses, enabling computation of performance metrics.

• Found a notable difference in effect size, indicating potential for significant improvement with consistent LLM guidance, although no statistical significance in performance improvement was observed.

• Demonstrated the viability of LLMs as valuable tools in enhancing surgical training, potentially extending to more complex surgical procedures while addressing the increasing demand for surgeons by providing an automated, accurate training tool with custom, actionable feedback.
